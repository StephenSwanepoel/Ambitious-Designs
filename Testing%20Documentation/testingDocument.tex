	\section{Detailed Test Results}
	\subsection{Overview of Test Results}
	\begin {itemize}
	\item All unit tests were successful.
	\item J-Unit was used to create our unit tests for Smart Image Identifier as it is a strong unit testing framework for the Java programming language.
	\end {itemize}

	\subsection{Functional Requirements Tests Results}
		The following results were obtained from the tests conducted. The tests to produce the follow results have passed/failed and the reasons are stated below
		\subsubsection{Resize Image (TC 4.1.1)}	
			\begin {itemize}
				\item The image's dimensions were correct according to the size requested in the method.
			\end {itemize}
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
		\subsubsection{Grey-Scale Image (TC 4.1.2)}
		\begin {itemize}
			\item The image was successfully stripped of all colours except black and white.
		\end {itemize}
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
		\subsubsection{Equalisation of Image (TC 4.1.3)}
		\begin {itemize}
			\item The contrast within the image was successfully increased.
		\end {itemize}	
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
		\subsubsection{Generate Mat Object (TC 4.1.4)}
		\begin {itemize}
			\item A Mat object was successfully created which contains the pixels of a given image.
		\end {itemize}
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
		\subsubsection{Test Output/Result Image (TC 4.1.5)}
		\begin {itemize}
		\item Images are stored correctly in the respective folders based on the type of image it is (normal, grey-scaled, equalised) after it has been processed.
		\end {itemize}
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
		\subsubsection{Class Instantiation and Performance (TC 4.1.6)}
		\begin {itemize}
		\item All classes were correctly instantiated and the result is a running version of Smart Image Identifier.
		\end {itemize}
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
	\section{Other}
		\begin {itemize}
			\item 
			\item The contract in place stipulates how the system operates and procedures used. 
			\item Mock objects portray results of each image that has been successfully processed.
			\item 
		\end {itemize}
		
	\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}
		\begin {itemize}
			\item 
			\item Limitations of the test cases include: image formats are restricted to be in .jpg format for processing.
			\item The largest contributing factor to failed or inaccurate tests is the initial quality of the image before it has been altered. Images who's dimensions are smaller than that of the the image produced after resizing get pixelated and thus this stretches the pixels which will highly reduce the accuracy of the human detection.			
			\item Unfortunately we are restricted to the hardware components used by clients of Willburg (trail cameras) as they range in picture quality between the various models of trail cameras they provide. One way of addressing the problem would providing additional tests for images to pass.
