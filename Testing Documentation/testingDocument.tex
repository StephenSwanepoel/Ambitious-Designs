\section{Item Pass / Fail Criteria}
	A request is considered successful when it passes any of the following 2 tests.
	\begin {itemize}
		\item Normal human detection test
		\item Grey-scaled human detection test
		\item Equalised human detection test
	\end {itemize}
	If more than 2 of the above criteria are not met, the item will be considered failed
	
\section{Test Deliverables}
	\subsection {Test Plan}
		Each test is run individually and tested multiple times against various images to ensure the results are constant and return the desired results. If a test is failed a better inspection would take place as to why the test had failed and steps on rectifying any problem would follow.

	\section{Detailed Test Results}
	\label{sec:Results}
	\subsection{Overview of Test Results}
	\begin {itemize}
	\item All unit tests were successful.
	\item J-Unit was used to create our unit tests for Smart Image Identifier as it is a strong unit testing framework for the Java programming language.
	\end {itemize}

	\subsection{Functional Requirements Tests Results}
		The tests we have created for this module are contained within the file \href{https://github.com/StephenSwanepoel/Ambitious-Designs/blob/master/Smart\%20Image\%20Identifier/src/test/com/codeferm/opencv/PeopleDetect\_Test.java}{PeopleDetect\_Test.java} and \href{https://github.com/StephenSwanepoel/Ambitious-Designs}{Link to Github project}.


		The following results were obtained from the tests conducted. The tests to produce the follow results have passed/failed and the reasons are stated below
		
		\subsubsection{Resize Image (TC 4.1.1)}	
			\begin {itemize}
				\item The image's dimensions were correct according to the size requested in the method.
			\end {itemize}
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
		\subsubsection{Grey-Scale Image (TC 4.1.2)}
		\begin {itemize}
			\item The image was successfully stripped of all colours except black and white.
		\end {itemize}
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
		\subsubsection{Equalisation of Image (TC 4.1.3)}
		\begin {itemize}
			\item The contrast within the image was successfully increased.
		\end {itemize}	
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
		\subsubsection{Generate Mat Object (TC 4.1.4)}
		\begin {itemize}
			\item A Mat object was successfully created which contains the pixels of a given image.
		\end {itemize}
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
		\subsubsection{Test Output/Result Image (TC 4.1.5)}
		\begin {itemize}
		\item Images are stored correctly in the respective folders based on the type of image it is (normal, grey-scaled, equalised) after it has been processed.
		\end {itemize}
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
		\subsubsection{Class Instantiation and Performance (TC 4.1.6)}
		\begin {itemize}
		\item All classes were correctly instantiated and the result is a running version of Smart Image Identifier.
		\end {itemize}
		\paragraph{Result: Pass}
		
	\section{Other}
		\begin {itemize}
			\item Smart Image Identifier has a success rate of 68\%.
			\item The contract in place stipulates how the system operates and procedures used.
			\item The service contract used by the system can be seen in section 3.2 of the \href{https://github.com/StephenSwanepoel/Ambitious-Designs/blob/master/Architecture\%20Requirements/doc1.pdf}{Application requirements}  document. 
			\item Mock objects portray results of each image that has been successfully processed.
			\item Test images are used as mock objects inorder to test pre- and post-conditions of the service contract.
			\item Reasons why the tests failed include:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Non-consistent quality of images being processed. The environment from with each image originates is unique.
				\item Day time images have a higher success rate than night time pictures.
				\item Pixel quality per image is dependent on the model of trail camera purchased by the project owner (Willburg)'s client.
			\end{itemize}
		\end {itemize}
\newpage		
	\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}
		\begin {itemize}
			\item We will approach these problems by further inspection of the source code to where possible tweaks may be made and perhaps the addition of new test cases.
			\item Limitations of the test cases include: image formats are restricted to be in .jpg format for processing.
			\item The largest contributing factor to failed or inaccurate tests is the initial quality of the image before it has been altered. Images who's dimensions are smaller than that of the the image produced after resizing get pixelated and thus this stretches the pixels which will highly reduce the accuracy of the human detection.			
			\item The restrictions are limited to the hardware components used by clients of Willburg (trail cameras) as they range in picture quality between the various models of trail cameras they provide. One way of addressing the problem would providing additional tests for images to pass.
		\end {itemize}
